# About
Project D.O.W Stands for Datesta, Omar, Wayil. We created this to find places nearby that are the same distance apart. Also you can add your favorite places.

## Usage
First get a Google Maps API Key to test it locally. Or view it on Heroku.

## Future Updates
In the future it will utilize a database and have user input. Possibly multiple maps per group that sign up. All new users need is to get a Google Maps API Key.
